What you need:
    1. Rasberry Pi
    2. Pi Camera
    3. PWM
    4. EMO
    5. ESC
    6. Two cars (one has to have Pi, PiCamera, PWM, EMO, and ESC)
    7. donkeycar framework
       you can download from (https://github.com/tawnkramer/donkey)
    8. Files: cfg.py, myVehicle.py, convoyController.py, cvCam.py

How to Run:
    python myVehicle.py

How it works:
    1. Find a guiding car through the PiCamera.
    2. If a guiding car found, calculate the distance, calculate the
      angle
    3. Get the right PWM_Steering value and PWM_Throttle value
    4. Pulse the right PWM_Steering valuse and PWM_Throttle to the
      PWM
    5. Move the car

How to find the guiding car:
    1. If the object that has width:150 and height:75, get the object
    2. get the x, y, w, h, and center

How to calculate:
    1. Using the Pythagorean thm, get the degree
    2. Return PWM_Steering and PWM_Throttle values
